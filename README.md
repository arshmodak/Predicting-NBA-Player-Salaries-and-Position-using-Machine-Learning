# Predicting-NBA-Player-Salaries-and-Position-using-Machine-Learning
NBA is the men’s professional basketball league in North America, composed of 30 teams that compete with each other to win the Larry O’Brien Championship Trophy – previously known as Walter A. Brown Trophy. Our data set consists of data from 1996 to 2020, for all seasons and all 30 teams. A team has a maximum of 12 players. We have scraped three data sets according to three different positions of a player: Forward, Center and Guard. All three data sets have information on all the stats of the players such as player name, team name, points per game, rebounds per game, no. of wins, losses etc.  We aim to find relations between various player stats and use them to predict which of the three positions a player is best suitable to play in. Furthermore, we also want to predict the efficiency of a player and their salary according to their performance in the games over time.
